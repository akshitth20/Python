"""
Write a text-based version of the game Memory. The game should generate a 5 × 5 board (see
the exercise from Chapter 8). Initially the program should display the board as a 5 × 5 grid of
asterisks. The user then enters the coordinates of a cell. The program should display the grid
with the character at those coordinates now displayed. The user then enters coordinates of
another cell. The program should now display the grid with the previous character and the
new character displayed. If the two characters match, then they should permanently replace
the asterisks in those locations. Otherwise, when the user enters the next set of coordinates,
those characters should be replaced by asterisks. The game continues this way until the player
matches everything or runs out of turns. You can decide how many turns they player gets
